# PPRL Orchestrator

The **PPRL Orchestrator** is a framework designed to simplify the integration and usage of privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) systems. It provides an abstraction layer over different PPRL implementations, offering a vendor-agnostic interface that enables seamless switching between PPRL systems without requiring operational overhead.

This repository will contain the development of both the specifications and the reference implementation of the PPRL Orchestrator. The goal is to streamline the process of adopting different privacy-preserving record linkage technologies, making it easier for organizations to choose and switch between them as needed.

A publication detailing the initial design and specifications of the PPRL Orchestrator is currently under review. All related materials will be made publicly available in this repository once the manuscript is accepted for publication.
